# Visual DOM

A visual representation of the Document Object Model to aid in web development.

## Features

- Visualize nested children in your HTML
- Each node provides the element's ID and tag name
- Managing 100+ `<div>`s has never been this easy!

## How to use this in your project:

1. Download and extract .zip
2. Place 'package' directory in the root of your project
3. Add vdom.css `<link>` tag to `<head>` (below your personal stylesheet)  
```<link rel="stylesheet" href="./package/vdom.css">```
4. Add vdom.js `<script>` tag to `<body>`
5. Build out your project, and Visual DOM will render additional elements in the `<body>` below your markup!
6. Done with Visual DOM? Remove the `<link>` and `<script>` tags associated with Visual DOM, and remove 'package' directory from your project.
